# What is AWS Launch Wizard for Exchange Server?<a name="what-is-launch-wizard-exchange"></a>

AWS Launch Wizard for Exchange Server guides you through the sizing, configuration, and deployment of Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 environments on the AWS Cloud\. Exchange Server is a messaging and collaboration solution that Microsoft developed, with support for mailboxes, calendars, and e\-archival\. The deployment includes best practices for configuring a highly available, fault\-tolerant, and secure Exchange environment\.

This Launch Wizard deployment provides a guided console experience that uses CloudFormation templates for deployment\. The templates are based on the [Microsoft Exchange on the AWS Cloud Quick Start deployment guide](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-microsoft-exchange/)\. Launch Wizard reduces the time it takes to deploy Exchange Server to the cloud\. Launch Wizard provides an estimated cost of deployment, and you can modify your resources and instantly view the updated cost assessment\. When you approve, Launch Wizard provisions and configures the selected resources to create a fully\-functioning production\-ready Exchange Server deployment\. It also creates custom AWS CloudFormation templates, which can be reused and customized for subsequent deployments\.
