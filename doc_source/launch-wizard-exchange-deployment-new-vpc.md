# Deploy Exchange Server into a new Amazon Virtual Private Cloud<a name="launch-wizard-exchange-deployment-new-vpc"></a>

The following steps guide you through an Exchange Server deployment with AWS Launch Wizard after you have launched it from the console\.

1. On the AWS Launch Wizard Console's landing page, use the **Choose application** button\. This opens the Choose application wizard where you are prompted to select the type of application that you want to deploy\.

1. Select **Exchange**, select **Deploy Exchange into a new VPC**, then select **Create deployment\.**

1. You are prompted to enter the specifications for the new deployment\. The following tabs provide information about the specification fields of the deployment model\.

------
#### [ General ]
   + **Deployment name**\. Enter a unique application name for your deployment\.
   + **Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic ARN â€” optional**\. Specify an Amazon SNS topic where AWS Launch Wizard can send notifications and alerts\. For more information, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)\.
   + **Deactivate rollback on failed deployment**\. By default, if a deployment fails, your provisioned resources will be deleted\. You can enable this setting during deployment to prevent this behavior\.
   + **Tags \- optional**\. Enter a key and value to assign metadata to your deployment\. For help with tagging, see [Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html)\.
