1. Select **Active Directory**, select **Extend on\-premises AD into an existing VPC**, then select **Create deployment\.**

1. Review and acknowledge that the required IAM permissions are met before proceeding\. For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for AWS Launch Wizard](launch-wizard-security.md#identity-access-management)\.
