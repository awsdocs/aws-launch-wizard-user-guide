# Deploy standalone Remote Desktop Gateway into a new Amazon Virtual Private Cloud<a name="launch-wizard-remote-desktop-gateway-deployment-steps-new-vpc"></a>

The following steps guide you through a Remote Desktop Gateway deployment with AWS Launch Wizard after you have launched it from the console\.

1. When you select **Choose application** from the AWS Launch Wizard landing page, you are directed to the Choose application wizard where you are prompted to select the type of application that you want to deploy\.

1. Select **Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway**, select **Deploy into a new VPC**, then select **Create deployment\.**

1. You are prompted to enter the specifications for the new deployment\. The following tabs provide information about the specification fields of the deployment model\.

------
#### [ General ]
   + **Deployment name**\. Enter a unique application name for your deployment\.
   + **Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\) topic ARN â€” optional**\. Specify an Amazon SNS topic where AWS Launch Wizard can send notifications and alerts\. For more information, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)\.
   + **Deactivate rollback on failed deployment**\. By default, if a deployment fails, your provisioned resources will be deleted\. You can enable this setting during deployment to prevent this behavior\.
   + **Tags \- optional**\. Enter a key and value to assign metadata to your deployment\. For help with tagging, see [Tagging Your EC2 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html)\.

#### [ Network configuration ]
   + **Key pair name**\. Select an existing key pair from the dropdown list or create a new one\. If you select **Create new key pair name**, you are directed to the Amazon EC2 console\. From there, under **Network and Security**, choose **Key Pairs**\. Choose **Create a new key pair**, enter a name for the key pair, and then choose **Download Key Pair**\.
**Important**  
This is the only opportunity for you to save the private key file\. Download it and save it in a safe place\. You must provide the name of your key pair when you launch an instance and provide the corresponding private key each time that you connect to the instance\. Return to the Launch Wizard console and choose the refresh button next to the **Key Pairs** dropdown list\. The newly created key pair appears in the dropdown list\. For more information about key pairs, see [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs and Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)\.
   + **Availability Zone \(AZ\) configuration:** You must choose at least two Availability Zones\. Deployment will create a highly available architecture that spans these Availability Zones\.
