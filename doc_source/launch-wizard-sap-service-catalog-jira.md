# Launch AWS Service Catalog products with Jira<a name="launch-wizard-sap-service-catalog-jira"></a>

AWS Service Catalog products created with AWS Launch Wizard can be integrated with Jira workflows\. You can use the AWS Service Catalog Connector for Jira to natively provision and operate AWS Service Catalog products created with Launch Wizard by using Atlassian's Jira Service Management\. This workflow simplifies product request actions for Jira Service Management users and provides Jira Service Management governance and oversight over AWS products\.

+ Create a deployment using Launch Wizard by choosing the **Create an AWS Service Catalog product** option in the infrastructure settings in Launch Wizard\. For more information, see [Define infrastructure](launch-wizard-sap-deploying.md#launch-wizard-sap-infrastructure)\.
+ Install the AWS Service Catalog Connector for Jira\. For information about how to install the Connector, see [AWS Service Management Connector for ServiceNow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/integrations-jiraservicedesk.html)\.
+ Complete the [set up steps to launch AWS Service Catalog products](launch-wizard-sap-service-catalog.md#launch-wizard-sap-service-catalog-setup)\.
